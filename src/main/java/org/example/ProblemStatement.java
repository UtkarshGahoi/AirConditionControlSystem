//    You already have some methods to use:
//
//    getTemp() // get current temperature
//    heat() // heating mode
//    cool() // cooling mode
//    off() // turn off the air condition
//    Please desgin the following methods (like a remote control):
//
//    setToHeat()/setToCool()
//    setTemp()
//    switchOn()/switchOff()
//    When the air condition is running, you should make sure that the room temperature can always reach the temperature you set. It means that if current temperature is lower than your target temperature, the air condition should be turned on. And if current temperature is higher than your target temperature, the air condition should standby.
//
//    How to desgin these method?
